= Description
   A Ruby implementation for native Windows threads.

= Warning
   This is a highly unstable and experimental attempt to wrap native Windows 
   threads.

= Synopsis
   require 'win32/thread'

   thread = Win32::Thread.new('a', 'b'){ |x,y| puts "X: #{x}, Y: #{y}" }
   puts "Done"
   thread.join

= Installation
   rake install (non-gem) or rake install_gem (gem)

= Technical Notes
   This wraps the CreateThread() function from the Windows API. It passes
   the block and its parameters to a thread function, where it is then
   executed.

= Known Bugs
   Segfaults when you attempt to create more than one thread.
   Does not seem to handle arguments to the thread block correctly when more
   than one thread is created.
	
= Future Plans
   Eliminate known bugs
   Add more methods
