= Description
   A Ruby wrapper for native Windows API thread functions.

= WARNING
   This was a highly unstable and experimental attempt to wrap native Windows 
   threads and should not be used. It was originally written before Ruby
   supported native threads.

   The gems for this library have been yanked, and this library should be
   considered unsupported. Please do not post issues. It has been left online
   for academic/historical interest only.

= Synopsis
   require 'win32/thread'

   thread = Win32::Thread.new('a', 'b'){ |x,y| puts "X: #{x}, Y: #{y}" }
   puts "Done"
   thread.join

= Installation
   rake install (non-gem) or rake install_gem (gem)

= Technical Notes
   This wraps the CreateThread() function from the Windows API. It passes
   the block and its parameters to a thread function, where it is then
   executed.

= Known Bugs
   Segfaults when you attempt to create more than one thread.
   Does not seem to handle arguments to the thread block correctly when more
   than one thread is created.
	
= Future Plans
  None. See warning above.
